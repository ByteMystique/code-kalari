I'm locked in this room for 10 hours, I have no idea what to do.

00:08.700 --> 00:11.600
We got one room of skew, and I got seven hours,

00:11.600 --> 00:15.100
and I want people to solve it in this goddamn airport.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.100
Let's do that stuff.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.500
That's one minute, and one interrogation later, off to Kenya.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.500
See you tomorrow.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.500
See you in Nairobi.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.500
See you in Nairobi.
