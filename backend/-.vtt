00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
I just spent all day coming back from the Amazon.

00:07.760 --> 00:12.080
And to tell you how much I like the Amazon, I'm going to take you on a boat ride.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.760
The boat ride begins here, where the Amazon does.

00:15.760 --> 00:21.200
At the intersection of the Black River and the White River, together they form the Amazon

00:21.200 --> 00:22.200
River.

00:22.200 --> 00:26.480
And as you take your boat through its waters, you will say to yourself, that must be

00:26.480 --> 00:27.480
heaven.

00:27.480 --> 00:32.280
The better, makes a perfect mirror of the clear blue skies, the shy dolphins pop up to

00:32.280 --> 00:37.800
make an appearance as the rain does, too, because well, it's a rain forest.

00:37.800 --> 00:43.120
But when it stops raining, your spot is lost on the nearby tree, a shiny piranha under

00:43.120 --> 00:47.880
your boat, a bird flying over your boat, and the tree is so big, you'll think it's

00:47.880 --> 00:49.520
the biggest in the world.

00:49.520 --> 00:53.640
And even at night, the Amazon is filled with life.

00:53.640 --> 00:57.120
The Amazon is much more than the river going through trees.

00:57.120 --> 01:01.640
The Amazon is by far the most magical place I've ever seen.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.640
That's the Amazon.

01:02.640 --> 01:03.640
That's one minute.

01:03.640 --> 01:04.160
See you tomorrow.
